A data science project to help clients/stakeholders connect the dots of the complex, interwoven global supply chain, using the emerging 5G mobile phone space as a test case.

Make predictions/recommendations about the shortest, most economical delivery route, and suppliers with the best qualifications and fit.  

Technology stack and data sources:

  - Neo4j graph database
     * https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-database/
  - Various Python machine learning and data visualization libraries
  - API calls to:
      * https://permid.org/
      * https://labs.refinitiv.com/dataexplorationtool
  
Algorithms and data science techniques, applied and under development:
  - Pathfinding and search (finds optimal path through Shortest Distance and other algorithms; evaluates route availability, quality)
  - Community Detection (clustering, classification, partition)
  - Centrality (determine the importance of distinct nodes in the network)
  - Heuristic link prediction (estimates of the likehood of nodes forming a relationship)
